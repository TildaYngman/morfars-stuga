A personal project produced by,
Felix Odenhall and Matilda Yngman 

This is Our combined personal end project through Hyper Island (HI).
The brief we got from HI:

"FRONTEND DEVELOPER
The students will drive a project of their 
own choosing, and turn their ideas into 
reality. During this project, the students 
will use the abilities they have learned so 
far to practice, deepen, and show their 
understanding of the digital industry and 
a Frontend Developer role."

Personal Brief for project
"A pair project with individual responsibility. 
Creating a booking/information web application for a Family business cabin rental. The application needs to be deliverable with a booking request system and Q&A component, as well as information about the cabin."

....

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
